Hi there!

I am Yiwei Ding. I'm a master's student at Georgia Institute Technology. My major is Music Technology, and I am doing research in the [Music Informatics Group](https://musicinformatics.gatech.edu/), led by [Prof. Alexander Lerch](https://www.alexanderlerch.com/).

My research includes music information retrieval tasks, representation learning for audio and music, music source separation. Basically, I like all tasks that teaches the computer to listen or to process audio and music. In addition, I am interested in machine learning theory and artificial intelligence.

Before joining Georgia Tech, I completed my bachelor's degree at Fudan University in Shanghai, majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology.

*As my hometown, Shanghai has always been and will always be my favorite city - it's metropolitan, modern, international and convenient. Being born-and-bred in Shanghai, I have my dearest family, teachers, friends, and countless unforgettable memories there.*

*Besides work and research, I enjoy listening to music and playing the piano. I played erhu, a traditional Chinese instrument when I was young and have been practing the piano since the covid year. My favorite composer (as in Dec. 2023) is Sergei Rachmaninoff. I also enjoy reading classic literature and contemporary philosophy. My favorite author is Hermann Hesse and my favorite philosopher is Herbert Marcuse.*
